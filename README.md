# Cricket Score Predictor

This project utilizes machine learning to predict the final score of a T20 cricket match using scikit-learn's linear regression algorithm.

Data Set:

Historical T20 match data is required, including features like:
Runs scored off each delivery (including extras).

Wickets lost (including the batsman dismissed).

Overs bowled (current over and decimal representation of balls bowled).

Identity of the batsman on strike (striker).

Identity of the batsman at the non-striker end (non-striker).

Focus on Ball-by-Ball Dynamics:

This approach captures the dynamic nature of T20 cricket by focusing on what's happening in the current match.

Features like runs, wickets, and overs directly reflect the match's progress.

Striker and non-striker information could be used to account for individual player strengths and recent form.

Model Building:

Scikit-learn's Linear Regression model is trained on the historical data.

The model learns the relationship between the features and the final score.

Prediction:

For a new T20 match, the same features are collected.

The trained model predicts the final score based on the learned relationship.

Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) to assess the accuracy of score predictions.

Limitations:

Cricket is a dynamic sport with several unpredictable factors.

The model's accuracy is limited by the quality and comprehensiveness of the data.

Further Enhancements:

Explore other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest) for potentially better predictions.
Incorporate real-time data during a match (e.g., current score, wicket falls) for more dynamic predictions.
